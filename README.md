# Obstacle_Avoiding-Robot
Autonomous Obstacle Avoiding Robot using Arduino Uno. It uses an ultrasonic sensor on a servo motor to detect obstacles, and DC motors with a motor driver shield for movement. Stops, scans, and turns to avoid collisions, demonstrating real-time sensor-based navigation and motor control.
